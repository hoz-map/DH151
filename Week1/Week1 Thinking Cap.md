# What is the site's agenda?
The site discusses the prevalence and death rates of heart disease and stroke in each county/state in the United States.

# Why does this website “speak” to you?
The reason why this map speaks to me is it showing clear disease concentrations in the US. There is not only disease information but also some other healthcare information, including healthcare cost, that can be mapped. Additionally, you can put maps side-by-side for data comparison. This is why this map is very interesting to me who is interested in healthcare issues.

# How does the mapping work, and does it “work?”
This mapping work by choosing disease and demographic data you want to know. In addition, the map can also visualize some additional health/demographic-related information, such as medical beneficiaries with heart disease. However, the visualizations of those additional data only work on the county level mapping. In terms of the coloring, the higher an area has prevalence of a disease, the darker it is colored. 

# What technologies does the map use?
This map uses ESRI ArcGIS. 

# If you could change something, what would it be?
Due to the various features of the map, including a feature you can set maps side-by-side, this website is great for comparing differences in places and disease prevalences and observing changes over the years. Therefore, I think there are not many parts to be changed.
