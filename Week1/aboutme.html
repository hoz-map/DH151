        <p>Hello, my name is <b>Hozumi Oshida</b> and I am a senior majoring in Sociology with Global Health and Digital Humanities double minor at UCLA. I am taking DH151 because I enjoyed learning to code when I took a python coding class last quarter. For the coding class, I created <a href="https://arcg.is/19XH1W0" target="_blank">this StoryMap</a> to visualize some data about floods in Indonesia. My goal for this course is <b>to learn about the functions of HTML/CSS and the effective ways to use these for social science research.</b> I am looking forward to gaining more technical skills from this course!</p>
