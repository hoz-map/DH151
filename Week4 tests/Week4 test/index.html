		<h1>Plastic Wastes in the World</h1>

		<p><h3>What I was planning to show on the map</h3> 
			I was going to create two types of markers. The one is to show the top 10 countries that produce the most plastic waste, which was supposed to be marked in red. The other one is to show the bottom 10 countries that produce the least plastic waste, which was supposed to be marked in green.</p> 

		<p><h3>What it is shown on the map</h3> 
			Green circles indicate the top 10 countries which generate a high amount of plastic waste per person per day.</p>
