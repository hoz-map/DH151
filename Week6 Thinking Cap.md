**What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"**

While mapping is mainly the representation of places, thick mapping shows the narratives of places, including historical backgrounds, by collecting data and combining layers.
In terms of my thoughts on thick mapping, I really like this concept of deep mapping and believe it is a very important tool since it allows us to understand places comprehensively.
For example, based on my experience, thick mapping helped me explain how historical redlining affected the way the neighborhoods in South LA were built and how it impacted today's health conditions of people living in South LA.

**How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?**

The theory of thick mapping informs us of the complex backgrounds of places. In my case, it gives me a great tool to show real-world sociological inequalities and explain how and why those inequalities are caused.
In sociology classes, we usually learn about social inequalities from textbooks and articles. However, creating a thick mapping allows me to actually observe the real-world sociological problems and gives me a better understanding of what potentially causes those issues.
