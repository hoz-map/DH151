		<h1>My Favorite Museums</h1>
		<ul>
		<li> <b>National Museum of Nature and Science</b> does many exhibitions from foreign museums. When I was small, my grandparents took me to this museum. One of my favorite exhibitions was about ancient Egypt. Since then, I have been interested in art history.</li>

		<li> <b>Legions of Honor</b> was my first US museum I visited. At the time, I was learning about ancient Greek art in my art history class, which was why I went to this museum for the ancient Greek art exhibition.</li>

		<li> I visited the <b>American Museum of Natural History</b> when my friend and I traveled to New York. Although there are a lot of sections where you can learn about animals and nature, this museum also displays ancient American art, which is one of my favorite arts.</li>

		<li> <b>Philadelphia Museum of Art</b> is my number one museum. Not only were artifacts exceptional, but also the decorations of each room were detailed. I want to visit this museum again in the future.</li>

		<li> Pop art is also one of my favorite arts, and this is why I wanted to visit <b>Los Angeles County Museum of Art</b> to see Andy Warhol's paintings. When I went there, I was not able to see all exhibits. Thus, I might revisit the museum in the near future.</li>
