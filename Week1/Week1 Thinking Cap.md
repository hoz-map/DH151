# What is the site's agenda?
The site discuss the prevalence and death rates of heart disease and stroke in each county/states in the United States.

# Why does this website “speak” to you?


# How does the mapping work, and does it “work?”

# What technologies does the map use?
This map use ESRI ArcGIS. 

# If you could change something, what would it be?
Due to the various features of the map, inlcuding a feature you can set maps side-by-side, this website is great for comparing differences in places and disease prevalences and observing changes over the years. Therefore, I think there are not many parts to be changed.
