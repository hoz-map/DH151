# What is the site's agenda?

# Why does this website “speak” to you?

# How does the mapping work, and does it “work?” i.e., in your opinion, does it do what it’s supposed to do?

# What technologies does the map use? I.e. Google maps, leaflet, mapbox, etc?

# If you could change something, what would it be?
